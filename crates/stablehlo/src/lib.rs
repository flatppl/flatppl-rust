//! `flatppl-stablehlo` — prints textual StableHLO from post-`determinize`
//! FlatPDL.
//!
//! This crate only *emits*: it takes a FlatPDL [`Module`] (the deterministic
//! profile produced by `flatppl-determinizer`, which has already eliminated
//! the measure layer) and lowers it to StableHLO's textual MLIR dialect. It
//! never determinizes on its own — callers run `flatppl_determinizer::determinize`
//! first, and `emit` refuses (never mis-lowers) if the input still carries
//! measure-layer constructs.
//!
//! This is Task 1 of the backend: crate scaffold only. `emit` is a stub that
//! asserts FlatPDL-conformance and returns a minimal empty module; later tasks
//! fill in the real emitter and op registry.
//!
//! Task 2 adds the `Type`/`Dim` → MLIR `tensor<…>` mapping ([`mlir_type_of`],
//! [`MlirTy`]) that every later emitter task builds SSA values on top of.
