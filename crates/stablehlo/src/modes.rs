//! The mode builders — [`emit_logdensity_abi`] and [`emit_sample_abi`] — that
//! turn a determinized FlatPDL [`Module`] into one complete `func.func`
//! StableHLO module, driven by the model's explicit `inputs`/`outputs`
//! compilation ABI (see [`Abi`]/[`read_abi`]).
//!
//! **Free parameters vs. fixed data.** A determinized module's top-level
//! bindings carry a `Phase` (spec §04): `elementof(...)`-declared parameters
//! are `Phase::Parameterized`, everything derived from them (including the
//! query itself) is *also* `Parameterized` (phase is a taint over the whole
//! dependent subtree, not a leaf marker), and already-pinned observed data is
//! `Phase::Fixed`. The phase alone therefore cannot identify the free
//! parameters — [`is_free_param`] also checks that the binding's RHS is
//! *structurally* a bare `elementof(...)` call, i.e. a parameter *declaration*
//! rather than a computation that merely depends on one.
//!
//! Each ABI input becomes a fresh `func.func` argument (`%argN : tensor<...>`,
//! in the declared `inputs` order — no source-order dependence), and its RHS
//! `NodeId` is [`Emitter::bind`]-seeded to that argument's [`Value`] *before*
//! the query is walked. This is essential, not cosmetic: `elementof` has no
//! op-map lowering (it is a declaration, not a computation), so if the query
//! walk ever reached an unbound `elementof(...)` node directly, it would
//! refuse. Pre-binding means a `Ref` back to the parameter resolves straight
//! to the pre-allocated `Value` via `Emitter::lower_node`'s memo, and the
//! `elementof` node itself is never visited. Fixed data needs no special
//! handling: `Emitter::lower_node`'s ordinary `Lit` dispatch turns a fixed
//! scalar leaf into a `stablehlo.constant` when the query walk reaches it.
//!
//! An input with no single tensor form — a `load_data` over a table or record
//! valueset — is instead destructured into ONE ARGUMENT PER COLUMN
//! ([`bind_input`]/[`aggregate_columns`]), each pre-bound through
//! [`Emitter::bind_column`] so a column access resolves to it. The aggregate
//! node stays unbound, so using the whole table in tensor position refuses.
//!
//! **Designating the query.** Nothing in FlatPDL marks a binding as "the"
//! output; the query is designated *explicitly* by the reserved
//! `outputs = (…)` binding ([`read_abi`]). The last-public-binding heuristic
//! this module once used — which was silent-wrong-result-capable, since
//! [`Module`]'s own doc disclaims that binding order carries spec meaning —
//! has been removed: a module declaring neither `inputs` nor `outputs` is
//! refused by [`crate::emit`] rather than guessed at. [`emit_logdensity_abi`]
//! lowers each declared output; `inputs` is exhaustive over the module's
//! `elementof` parameters (a parameter missing from `inputs` refuses).
//!
//! **`@sample`.** [`emit_sample_abi`] mirrors [`emit_logdensity_abi`] but
//! threads the rng key: the leading `%key : tensor<2xui64>` argument (spec §07
//! `rand(rstate, m) -> (value, new_rstate)`) is bound from the rng source
//! reachable from the declared output ([`find_rng_source`]) — NOT drawn from
//! `inputs`, and the rng-source binding is exempt from the inputs-exhaustiveness
//! check — and the function returns the two-result `(value, new_key)` pair. The
//! declared sample output's value component (a value-terminal `rand(rng,
//! lawof(x))` lowers to `get0(builtin_sample(rng, ctor, kernel_input), 0)`) is
//! projected by [`Emitter::lower_node`]'s dispatch, which recognizes a
//! `get0`/`get` projection of a `builtin_sample` call structurally and reads
//! the registry's already-computed drawn value straight through (see
//! `Emitter::sample_tuple_slot`).
